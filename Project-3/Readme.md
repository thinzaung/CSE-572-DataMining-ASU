# Project 3 - Meal Cluster Validation using K-Mean, DBscan

In this project, we will apply Cluster Validation methods such as K-Mean, DBScan to classified meal data extracted from Project 2 (using the same feature matrix).
After that we will calculate SSE, Entropy and Purity data of these clusters too.
